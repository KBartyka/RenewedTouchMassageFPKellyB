                <dd>Varicose veins, undiagnosed lumps or bumps, pregnancy, bruising, cuts, abrasions, sunburn,
                or undiagnosed pain</dd><br>
        </dl>
        <h5>Medical Contraindications</h5><br>
        <dl>
            <dt>Massage with these conditions must have written approval by your doctor prior to massage:</dt>
                <dd>Cardio-vascular (thrombosis, hypertension, phlebitis[vein inflammation], heart conditions),
                untreated high blood pressure, cancer, epilepsy, diabetes, trapped or pinched nerves, among other
                    issues being treated by a medical doctor.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h5>Total Contraindications</h5><br>
        <dl>
        <dt>When you have any of these conditions, please do not book a massage:</dt>
        <dd>Fever, contagious diseases (including any cold or flu - no matter how mild), recent operations or acute

        <h5>Do contraindications mean massage treatment cannot take place?</h5><br>
        <p>Not always. In fact, massage can be very therapeutic for many medical conditions. However, in the above cases
            it is best to have advice from your physician. Massage therapists, unless they are also qualified doctors,
            may not, under law, attempt to diagnose a condition.</p>
