    <h2>Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Please arrive freshly showered</li>
        <li>Please plan to use the restroom prior to the start of your session.</li>
        <li>First time visits are required to fill out a confidential health history form prior to treatment to allow for an initial health assessment.</li>
        <li>Discuss any medical conditions or problem areas prior to start of session</li>
        <li>Prior to lying on the massage table, please remove all jewelry and place on the dish in the room</li>
        <li>Please turn off your cell phone, or set to silent. Avoiding/elminating distractions will create a more
        relaxing session for both you and your therapist.</li>
        <li>Undress to your level of comfort, and lay underneath the sheet and blanket on the table</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What to Expect During Your Massage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>During your massage session, if you like chatting, we'll chat. But if you prefer to relax in silence,
            this will be respected. It is important that you feel comfortable doing so.</li>
        <li>Only the area of the body being worked on will be uncovered. Professional draping/covering is of utmost importance.</li>
        <li>Warm, steamed towels may be incorporated into your massage, dependent on the type of massage and what would be
        most effective in the treatment.</li>
        <li>Always communicate any requests or concerns to your Massage Therapist during your treatment.
            Your level of comfort is top priority!.  YOUR FEEDBACK IS IMPORTANT!</li>
        <li>Your therapist has the right to terminate the session if there are any unwelcomed or inappropriate requests
            (such as sexual in nature) by you during the session.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>After Your Session</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You may feel tired after your session. This is completely normal, so schedule time to rest.
            Massage relaxes your body and de-stresses your mind. This is your time to recover and get re-balanced.</li>
        <li>You may feel re-energized. It all depends on the type of massage you received and what your objectives were for your massage.</li>
        <li>Drink more water than you normally do for the next 48 hours. During a massage, your circulation increases,
            and improves metabolic processes. This also increases the wastes that your cells produce.
            Drinking water helps flush unwanted toxins and waste products from your body, and is beneficial
            to reduce soreness after a massage.</li>
        <li>If you had a therapeutic massage that focused on a specific injury or body part, you may experience
            some tenderness a day or two after your massage. Extensive therapeutic massage work may cause temporary
            inflammation and soreness, due to the release of lactic acid and other metabolic wastes.
            If you feel sore, drink more water, apply an ice pack to the area for 20 minutes, do gentle stretches,
            or take a warm bath with Epsom salts, which will draw the toxins out of your system. </li>
        <li>Pay attention to how your body responds to the massage. Remember to share with your therapist any adverse effects
            the next time you come in, so that the massage work can continue to help you achieve the most from your massage.</li>
    </ul>
