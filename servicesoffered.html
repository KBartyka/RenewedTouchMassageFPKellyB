    <h2>Types of Massage Sessions Offered</h2>
    <h3>Swedish Massage</h3>
        <p>One of the primary goals of the Swedish massage technique is to relax the entire body. This soothing massage
            uses mild to moderate pressure with benefits, including relief from aches, pains, decreased stress,
            enhanced mental clarity, improved appearance, greater flexibility, & improved circulation. Swedish massage
            techniques include circular pressure applied by the hands and palms, firm kneading, percussion-like tapping,
            bending and stretching.</p>
    <h3>Deep Tissue Massage</h3>
        <p>Deep tissue massage therapy is similar to Swedish massage, but the deeper pressure is beneficial
            in releasing chronic muscle tension. This type relieves tension, knots and pain. It can be a full-body massage
            or just certain parts that need to be focused on, using a deeper pressure. Highly effective for stress areas
            due to misalignment, repetitive motions & past injuries. It's used for chronic aches and pain and contracted areas
            such as a stiff neck and upper back, low back pain, leg muscle tightness, and sore shoulders.</p>
    <h3>Sports Massage</h3>
        <p>This massage enhances performance by helping to prevent injury, reduces pain and swelling, relaxes the mind,
            increases flexibility, improves recovery rates, and promotes the body's natural immune function.
            This massage helps to prevent injuries, prepare the body for athletic activity and maintain it
            in optimal condition.  It is designed to help athletes recover from workouts and injuries. Sports massage
            has three basic forms: pre-event massage, post-event massage, and maintenance massage.  Sports massage
            therapy is geared toward athletes of every kind, from world-class professionals to weekend joggers.
            Focusing on areas of the body that are overused and stressed from repetitive and often aggressive movements.</p>
    <h3>Cupping Massage</h3>

            It can also assist in treating pain and muscle spasms with the use of fixed or moving cups.
            Cupping therapy is an ancient form of alternative medicine. It serves many purposes, including to help with
