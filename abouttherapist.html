        <h3> Kelly Bartyczak is a Licensed Massage Therapist in the State of Wisconsin, and is a professional member of the
    American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA) since 2006</h3>
        <p>Kelly is a graduate of the Lakeside School of Massage from 2004. She started her career at a Nail Salon and Spa
        as a massage therapist.  She provided a variety of body services, from massages to body wraps.  Her career advanced
        to working at the Wisconsin Athletic Club in 2005, where she continues her work for over the past 14 years.
        She specializes in Swedish, Deep Tissue, Myofascial Release, Neuromuscular Therapy (NMT) and Cupping.</p>
        <p>Her Philosophy is: "Too often we underestimate the power of touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear,
            an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to
            turn a life around." ~Leo Buscaglia</p>
